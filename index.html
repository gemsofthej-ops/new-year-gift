i dont know where to begin with this but yes being with you is awesomesauce
you make everything so much better when you are around
u are like a budew using sunny day 🌱✨

i remember this one time in the canteen we were having lunch
i got so hyped seeing you get all of my references
specifically the riverdale and sitcom ones
i lowkey felt embarrassed after you left
(ofcourse not because u got bored but u had a practical right after)
cuz i thought i spoke too much
but yes it was then i first thought damn pearls valid

u did make the first move initially as well
cuz if u hadnt texted first my awkward ass probably
would never have even initiated a conversation
but i m so glad that u did

i did piss you off alot this year 😭
but come on u had fun too right
except the times i went overboard
for which i would like to formally apologise 😘

this one time during prelims
when i had come to the library
after which we were sitting in the canteen
i ordered cold coffee and i told u about my sister freya
and stuff going on with her
and i loved the way u reciprocated it
it was really nice of u to react that way and hear me out

you never judged me for my hot takes on life
or my philosophies
and most importantly i ve never thought i ve overshared to you
and for someone like me who yaps alot
that is a very common feeling
but never had that with u

all the rants that u heard
late night calls
thank you for everything babe

the day u told me that u liked me
was easily one of the best days of my life

delhi
poptos
momos
smoothie
micro burger
aamras
the list just goes on

having u by my side as my partner
romantic one ofcourse
is all i could ve asked for

i m not gonna start with caps on
because doing that and using the 😂 emoji is still 👎

but this year was s tier because of u
i want the next one to be with u too

Happy New Year, my love ❤️
